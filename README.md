# 4D Video Game

## Description
This is my final degree project, a video game that explores the concept of 4 spatial dimensions instead of the regular 3D. The game, titled "Realm Paradox," aims to make the 4th Dimension theory more approachable through engaging gameplay.

## Gameplay Overview
In Realm Paradox, players will embark on a puzzle-solving adventure that challenges them to understand and utilize 4D shapes to their advantage in order to reach the goal. The game consists of four levels, each offering a unique set of challenges and increasing difficulty. 

### Levels
1. **Playground Level:** This level serves as an interactive exploration space where players can familiarize themselves with the game mechanics and concepts related to the 4th Dimension without any danger or time constraints.
2. **Bridge Building Level:** In this level, players will need to construct bridges using 4D shapes to overcome gaps and obstacles, allowing them to progress further.
3. **Cave Tunnels Level:** Players must navigate a maze of cave tunnels by manipulating the 4th Dimension, finding hidden passages and avoiding dead ends to make their way through.
4. **Advanced Puzzles Level:** The final level presents players with complex puzzles that require a deep understanding of 4D shapes. Players will need to think critically and creatively to solve these challenges and reach the ultimate objective.
